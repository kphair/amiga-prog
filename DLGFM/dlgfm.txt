                    version 0.9b


This is a utility to help in fixing corrupted file listings, and also to
assist the SysOp in controlling his or her file areas. There are four
available options in this release of the program:

    o  Give a listing of an area, listing the file numbers, their
       names and the names of the uploaders. This is useful for
       checking to see who has been uploading to an area, and what
       kind of files are there, without having to log on locally.

    o  Save the first 80 characters of the BBS file description 
       into the file comment. This is useful for SysOps you want
       keep tape backups and perhaps restore files after an area
       has been reallocated. This is useful because of DLG's
       turbo upload option which allows the use of file comments
       to create the BBS file description.

    o  List the users who are in an area. This is useful for when
       a user complains about a particular area which they should
       not have access to (because they're barred, or whatever).
       This also has possibilities for remote SysOps who could
       perhaps get regular updates of all the "User.file" access
       files from the file areas, storing them in appropriate
       areas of their own drive. This would make it possible for
       them to see just who has access to what area if it becomes
       necessary to check.

    *  The most important option, and the reason the program was
       created in the first place. Occasionally, the "File.dat"
       database in an area would become corrupt, listing wrongly
       numbered files, or simply containing garbage (which can 
       somehow drop a user's carrier: Not good for a SysOp's 
       reputation!)


USING THE PROGRAM:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The program is controlled from the CLI. To use it, a file area number
must be provided, and then some options. For example, "DLGFM 1 -r" would
rebuild the file listing database in area 1 and set the file pointers in
that area correctly. This assumes that the files are numbered from 1 to
the last file with no gaps. A renumber may be required before using this
option.

Options:

 -r  Rebuild "File.dat" and "Pointers.file" in the specified area

 -c  Comment all files in the specified area which have a #?.fd
     description file using at most the first 80 characters of the 
     description. Split lines are joined so that as much as possible 
     of the description is used.

 -u  List of all the users allowed in the specified area.

 -s  List all the files in the specified area by number, with the
     uploader's name.


Using multiple options may work, i.e. DLGFM 1 -r -c, but I've not really
tested that bit yet.
