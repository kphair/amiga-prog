A little program to help manage DLG file areas more efficiently.

To use this program just enter DLGFM at a CLI prompt, it will  present
you with the syntax and options it takes...

    Usage: DLGFM Area [options]

    Options: LIST    File list of area (Number, Filename, Uploader)
             REBUILD Rebuild file.dat from existing .fd files
             KILLFD  Kill orphaned .fd files
             COMMENT Save file description into file comment
             ACCESS  List users with access to area
             FALIAS  Set all uploader names in area to aliases


Description of options:

    LIST:

        Lists all the files in the file area by number, listing
        the file name and the uploader beside it.

    REBUILD:

        This will rebuild the "file.dat" file in the area
        (useful for when it gets damaged, this used to happen a
        lot, and users would get rubbish displayed on their
        terminal when doing a quick file list.)

    KILLFD:

        This will scan the area and remove any .fd files for
        which there is no corresponding file. This is handy if
        you have done area maintenance using something like
        Directory Opus.

    COMMENT:

        This will scan the area and put the first 80 characters
        of a file's description into the file comment field.
        This can be useful if you archive the area and then use
        a 'turbo upload'-style option on another BBS system, or
        if the .fd file goes walkabout and you want to rebuild a
        basic description file.

    ACCESS:

        Lists all users who access the file area.

    FALIAS:

        Converts all user names in file descriptions to the user
        alias.


You will notice there's another option called  TOUCH  but  that's  not
written  yet.  What  it  will do is to set the date and time of a file
according to the fields in the .fd file.


Multiple options can be specified, for example:

    DLGFM 10 KILLFD REBUILD COMMENT FALIAS LIST

Options are processed in sequential order.


Any suggestions for more options are welcome.
